### This script assumes you have a web application packaged in a zip file and need to deploy it to a web server.
### Additionally, it performs tasks like stopping the web server, taking a backup, and then starting the server again.
### This is a simplified example for illustrative purposes    

# PowerShell Automation Script: Web Application Deployment

# Set paths and variables
$webAppZipPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\WebApp.zip"
$webAppExtractPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\WebApp"
$backupFolderPath = "C:\Path\To\Your\BackupFolder"
$webServerServiceName = "W3SVC"

# Stop the web server
Write-Host "Stopping the web server..."
Stop-Service -Name $webServerServiceName -Force

# Create a timestamp for the backup folder
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
$backupFolder = "Backup_$timestamp"

# Create the backup folder
$backupFolderPath = Join-Path -Path $backupFolderPath -ChildPath $backupFolder
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $backupFolderPath | Out-Null

# Take a backup of the web application
Write-Host "Taking a backup of the web application..."
Copy-Item -Path $webAppExtractPath -Destination $backupFolderPath -Recurse -Force

# Extract the new version of the web application
Write-Host "Extracting the new version of the web application..."
Expand-Archive -Path $webAppZipPath -DestinationPath $webAppExtractPath -Force

# Start the web server
Write-Host "Starting the web server..."
Start-Service -Name $webServerServiceName

Write-Host "Web application deployment completed successfully."


# This script performs the following tasks:
# Stops the web server service.
# Takes a backup of the existing web application.
# Extracts the new version of the web application from a zip file.
# Starts the web server service.
